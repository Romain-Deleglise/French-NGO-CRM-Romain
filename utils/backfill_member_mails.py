"""One-off backfill: attach past *manually-entered* member↔élu mails to members.

Before the automatic member-mail import existed, members logged their exchanges
with élu·es by hand via "+ Courriel". Those rows live in `mails` (+ `mail_persons`
for the élu·e) but carry no `mail_members` link — so they show in "Suivi des
échanges" but not as member exchanges (no 👥 tag, absent from member pages).

This script links each such mail to the right member, using the moderator who
logged it (`mails.received_by`) mapped to their @pauseia.fr address. Members are
upserted by e-mail, so a backfilled member MERGES with the one the automatic
import may already have created — no duplicates. Idempotent: a mail already
linked is skipped.

Mails whose logger isn't in MAPPING are left untouched and reported (e.g. members
who had no @pauseia.fr address at the time). Add them here and re-run once known.

Usage (in the app container):
    python3 utils/backfill_member_mails.py --dry-run
    python3 utils/backfill_member_mails.py
