"""One-off maintenance script — NOT part of the web app.

Inserts the members of the sitting government (produced by
utils/extract_gouvernement.py) into the app's `persons` table:

    python3 utils/extract_gouvernement.py     # refresh the JSON first
    python3 utils/insert_gouvernement.py

Unlike the députés/sénateurices imports, this one does NOT simply skip a person
who already exists. Ministers are usually sitting députés who were imported
earlier, so skipping would leave them looking like plain deputies forever.
Instead, for an existing person this script *adds* the government role to the
roles they already hold and fills in their portefeuille:

    "Député·e"  ->  "Ministre, Député·e"

Their `political_group` is left untouched — the annuaire carries no party
information at all, so the group already on the record (their real party, from
the AN/Sénat import) is strictly better than anything this script could set.

New people (ministers who hold no parliamentary seat) are created with
political_group "Gouvernement / Administration", since nothing better is known.

Idempotent: re-running adds no duplicate role and creates no duplicate person.
