"""Import campaign BCC mails into the CRM's moderation queue — cron-friendly.

Context (see the "Automatisation import des mails campagne → CRM" brief):
citizens use the site to write to their MP, and put a follow-up mailbox in BCC.
The copy landing in that mailbox keeps the MP's real address in the `To:` header,
so we can tell which parlementaire received a mail and when — without any manual
entry. This script reads that mailbox over IMAP, matches recipients against
`persons.email` (already filled for députés/sénateurs/eurodéputés by the insert
scripts), and stages one draft per matched person in `pending_mails`.

Nothing is published straight to the public record: drafts land in the very same
`pending_mails` queue as anonymous "declarer" submissions, so a certified (Tier 2)
member reviews each import on /moderation before it becomes a real mail. That is a
free safety net and reuses the existing flow.

Two output modes:
- Moderation (default): stage a draft in `pending_mails` for a Tier 2 member to
  validate on /moderation. Safest — use it while confirming matching is reliable.
- Auto-publish (`--auto-publish` or IMPORT_AUTO_PUBLISH=1): write straight into
  the real `mails` table with a structured `mail_persons` link to every matched
  person. Because matching yields a certain `persons.id` (email match or the
  X-Elu-Id marker), this is a clean full automation once the To: test is trusted.

Usage:
    # First run: sweep the whole mailbox history (into the moderation queue).
    python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --backfill

    # Daily cron: only messages with a higher IMAP UID than the last processed one.
    python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py

    # See what would be staged/published without writing anything.
    python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --backfill --dry-run

    # Full automation: publish directly to the real mails table.
    python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --auto-publish

Configuration (never hard-code the password — read it from the server env file,
e.g. /opt/volunteer-apps/secrets/website-meeting.env):
    IMAP_HOST          IMAP server            (default: imap.gmail.com)
    IMAP_PORT          IMAP SSL port          (default: 993)
    IMAP_USER          mailbox login          (e.g. suivi-campagne@pauseia.fr)
    IMAP_APP_PASSWORD  app password           (from Vaultwarden)
    IMAP_MAILBOX       folder to read         (default: INBOX)
    IMAP_DB_PATH       path to meetings.db    (default: <repo>/meetings.db)

Anti-duplicate strategy (both belt and braces):
- Incremental runs remember the last IMAP UID processed per mailbox and only fetch
  UIDs above it (robust to timezones / missed days, unlike a date filter).
- Every message's Message-ID is recorded, so the same mail is never staged twice
  even if UIDs reset (mailbox recreated) or a backfill overlaps a daily run.

Matching:
- Primary: an explicit marker header injected by the site — `X-Elu-Id` /
  `X-Depute-Id` carrying a `persons.id`. This is match-certain even if the
  official address changes.
- Fallback: every address found in `To`, `Cc`, `X-Original-To` and `Delivered-To`
  is matched case-insensitively against `persons.email`. One draft per matched
  person (a single mail may target several élu·es).
