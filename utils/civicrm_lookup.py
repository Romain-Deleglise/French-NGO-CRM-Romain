"""Resolve unknown mail addresses against CiviCRM — the on-demand half of the sync.

CiviCRM holds ~12 900 journalists. Copying them here would break the tool: the
rencontre and courriel forms render one <option> *and* one checkbox per person,
so a 17 000-row `persons` table turns the main data-entry screens into
multi-megabyte pages. And a journal of interactions has no use for 12 900 people
nobody has ever written to.

So a journalist earns a fiche the day a member actually exchanges mail with them:

  1. import_member_mails.py meets an address it cannot match and, instead of
     dropping it, records it in `civicrm_pending` (see enqueue below).
  2. This script prints those addresses (--list-pending); the host looks them up
     with `cv api4` — see utils/deploy/civicrm-sync.sh.
  3. This script reads the answer (--apply) and creates the fiche, with its
     média and its alignement.
  4. import_member_mails.py --backfill runs again; the address now matches, and
     the mail is recorded like any other. `imported_mails` keeps that sweep from
     duplicating anything.

An address CiviCRM doesn't know is marked 'absent' so it isn't looked up again
every night; --retry-absent puts them back in the queue after CiviCRM has been
enriched.
