# Seed the CRM with one narrow CiviCRM group, once, to get the cycle started.
#
# What it breaks: the on-demand path can only resolve an address against fiches
# that exist, and can only learn a média's address convention from addresses
# already held. With an empty press half every journalist mail is queued and
# none is attributed. Seeding one group puts real journalists in the CRM with
# their médias, and civicrm-sync.sh resolves the rest on demand from there.
#
# NB: this is not about Workspace. The rule feeding the audit mailbox matches
# `@pauseia\.fr` over full headers, so press mail has always been copied there.
#
# Deliberately NOT the bulk import: group 12 (Presse - Nationale) alone, not the
# 12 900 journalists, which would make the rencontre and courriel pickers
# unusable. civicrm_lookup.py refuses past its soft cap unless forced.
#
# Read-only on CiviCRM, like everything else here: `cv api4 ….get`.
