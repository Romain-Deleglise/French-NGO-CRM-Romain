# Elected-officials import scripts (`utils/`)

One-off **maintenance scripts** that seed the `persons` table in `meetings.db`
with the official lists of sitting deputies, senators and government members.

> ⚠️ Not part of the web app. The DB is filled *before* deployment and left
> alone afterwards (except when a moderator adds a person via the UI). These are
> kept so the lists can be **refreshed later**.

Run them from the repo root. All are **idempotent**: re-running one never
creates a duplicate person. The deputies and senators scripts simply skip a
`name` that already exists; the government script instead adds the missing role
to that person (see below).

## Layout

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `json/` | Raw Assemblée nationale open-data dump (`acteur/`, `organe/`, `deport/`) |
| `actual_dataset/deputes_officiel.json` | Extracted deputies, nosdeputes.fr format |
| `actual_dataset/senateurices_actifs.json` | Senators, Sénat open-data format |
| `actual_dataset/gouvernement.json` | Government members, downloaded by `extract_gouvernement.py` |

## 1. Download fresh data

```bash
# Deputies — AN open-data archive (actors + mandates + organs)
curl https://data.assemblee-nationale.fr/static/openData/repository/17/amo/deputes_actifs_mandats_actifs_organes/AMO10_deputes_actifs_mandats_actifs_organes.json.zip -o amo10.zip
unzip -o amo10.zip     # creates/updates json/

# Senators — Sénat API
curl https://www.senat.fr/api-senat/senateurs.json -o actual_dataset/senateurices_actifs.json

# Government — no manual download, extract_gouvernement.py calls the API itself.
```

## 2. Scripts

- **`extract_deputes.py`** — walks `json/acteur/`, keeps only sitting deputies
  (active `ASSEMBLEE` mandate), resolves each group via the `GP` mandate →
  `json/organe/`, and writes `actual_dataset/deputes_officiel.json` in the
  nosdeputes.fr format.
- **`insert_deputes.py`** — inserts those deputies into `persons`: role
  `Député·e`, `political_group` mapped to the exact `POLITICAL_GROUPS` label,
  `stance` `Inconnu`, plus `circonscription` and `email`.
- **`insert_senateurices.py`** — inserts senators: role `Sénateur·ice`, mapped
  group, `circonscription` (the Sénat data has no email). Also checks the group
  labels still match `app.py`.
- **`extract_gouvernement.py`** — downloads the sitting government (ministres,
  ministres délégué·es, secrétaires d'État, Premier·e ministre, Président·e) from
  the *Annuaire de l'administration* API into `actual_dataset/gouvernement.json`.
  The API has no party data, hence `political_group` = `Gouvernement /
  Administration`.
- **`insert_gouvernement.py`** — inserts them. If a member is already in
  `persons` (as `Député·e`, etc.), it **adds** the government role to the ones
  they already hold rather than skipping them, and keeps their real party:
  `"Député·e"` → `"Ministre, Député·e"`.

## 3. Full refresh (from repo root)

```bash
curl …AMO10…zip -o amo10.zip && unzip -o amo10.zip
curl https://www.senat.fr/api-senat/senateurs.json -o actual_dataset/senateurices_actifs.json
python3 utils/extract_deputes.py
python3 utils/insert_deputes.py
python3 utils/insert_senateurices.py
python3 utils/extract_gouvernement.py
python3 utils/insert_gouvernement.py
```

Copy `meetings.db` first: the government insert is the only one that *updates*
existing rows.

### Automatic weekly refresh (`sync_officials.py`)

The manual steps above are orchestrated by **`sync_officials.py`**, driven by a
weekly systemd timer (`deploy/sync-officials.{service,timer}`, Monday 05:30) — so
the officials stay in sync on their own. It covers **all four chambers**:
deputies, senators, government **and eurodéputés** (§7 scripts, called from here).
It downloads each source in **pure Python** (no `curl`/`unzip`): the AN open-data
zip (unzipped via `zipfile`), the Sénat API JSON, the government list
(self-fetched), and the MEPs (cached, see §7), then runs extract+insert per
chamber.

- **Per-chamber isolation:** a network or format failure on one chamber is
  reported but never blocks the others; the run exits non-zero if any failed.
- **`in_office` reconciliation:** after a *complete* run, persons present in any
  current roster are marked `in_office=1`, the others `0` (kept for history,
  shown with a "Non élu·e actuellement" badge). Handles the government
  multi-role case; never touches hand-entered rows (`added_by`/`validated_by`).
  Skipped if any chamber failed, so an incomplete union can't retire anyone.
- **Disk-safe:** the large AN dump is removed after extraction.
- **Election-proof-ish:** the AN dump URL carries the legislature number
  (`AN_LEGISLATURE`, default `17`); bump it after a general election.

The eurodéputé timer (`sync-eurodeputes`) is now **superseded** by this job.

```bash
python3 utils/sync_officials.py     # fetch + extract + insert, all four chambers
```

## 3 bis. The other two types de contact (journalistes, religieux·ses)

`persons` holds three kinds of contact — `Journaliste`, `Politique`,
`Religieux·se` — and `organisations` the three matching kinds: `Média`,
`Groupe politique`, `Culte`. The scripts above seed the political half. These
seed the other two. All are **dry-run by default**: they print what they would
do and write nothing until `--commit`, and all are idempotent, matched by name
*within their own type* so that a journaliste who shares a name with an élu·e
stays a separate fiche.

- **`insert_medias_journalistes.py`** — the 165 médias and 133 journalistes
  that came from the old journalist CRM, hard-coded in the file because that
  database was never version-controlled.
- **`insert_cultes.py`** — the religious organisations: each culte plus the
  body that actually speaks for it (CEF, FPF, CNEF, AEOF, Consistoire central,
  CRIF, Grande Mosquée de Paris, FORIF, UBF, CRCF). Fifteen rows, hard-coded.
- **`extract_eveques.py`** + **`insert_eveques.py`** — the ~120 French bishops
  from the Conférence des évêques de France's own annuaire. Creates each
  diocèse as a `Culte` organisation, sets the fonction from the title
  (`Évêque`, `Archevêque`, `Évêque auxiliaire`, `Cardinal`, `Nonce
  apostolique`) and the see as « Territoire assigné ». `émérite` in a title
  sets `in_office = 0`.

```bash
python3 utils/insert_medias_journalistes.py            # dry run
python3 utils/insert_medias_journalistes.py --commit
python3 utils/insert_cultes.py --commit
python3 utils/extract_eveques.py && python3 utils/insert_eveques.py --commit
```

> **Why there is no equivalent for the other cultes.** There is no open dataset
> worth importing. SIRENE's NAF `94.91Z` (renumbered `94.91Y` under NAF 2025)

> contact is made.

## 4. Sync élu·e emails from the sending tool (`sync_emails_from_elus.py`)

The CRM seeds `persons.email` **statically** at import time, and only deputies
were filled — senators (≈348) and government members have none. So mails to
senators never match in the importer below.

The "Écrire à mes élus" site (repo **pauseai-france**) already solves this: its
`scripts/generate-elus.js` builds `src/lib/data/elus.json` from **official open
data** — the data.gouv Assemblée nationale dataset (deputies) and the Sénat ODSEN
dataset (senators) — with a cross-checked `emailConfidence` per address. That file
is the exact source of the address the tool puts in a mail's `To:`. Syncing the
CRM from it makes CRM addresses line up with what is actually sent, so matching
is reliable.

```bash
# From a local checkout of the sending tool (recommended on the server):
python3 utils/sync_emails_from_elus.py --elus ../pauseai-france/src/lib/data/elus.json --dry-run
python3 utils/sync_emails_from_elus.py --elus ../pauseai-france/src/lib/data/elus.json

# Or fetch the committed file straight from GitHub (needs network):
python3 utils/sync_emails_from_elus.py --dry-run
```

Defaults are conservative: only **fills empty** emails, only trusts
**`high`** confidence, matches by normalised full name (both datasets build
`"Prénom Nom"` from the same official sources, so it is exact in practice), and
**never guesses** — a name not matched to a single elus entry is reported. Use
`--overwrite` to also replace a differing address, `--min-confidence medium|low`
to widen, `--db` / `IMAP_DB_PATH` for the DB path. Run this **before** the first
campaign-mail backfill so senator mails match.

> Senators who publish no email anywhere (≈15) stay without one — the sending
> tool falls back to their official contact form, and nothing can match them by
> address. That is expected, not a bug.

## 6. Members' correspondence with élu·es (`import_member_mails.py`)

Tracks the association's own members (@pauseia.fr) exchanging mail with élu·es —
**both directions** (member → élu = `sent`, élu → member = `received`) — and
attributes the member. Companion to the campaign importer; shares the same
matching/dedup helpers and the same DB.

**Capture (no per-member setup, newcomers covered automatically).** A Google
Workspace **content-compliance / routing rule** copies every message where one
side is an élu·e address (`@senat.fr` / `@assemblee-nationale.fr` /
`@europarl.europa.eu`) and the other a `@pauseia.fr` account into one audit
mailbox (e.g. `suivi-membres@pauseia.fr`). Set it up in
`admin.google.com → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Compliance → Content
compliance`: scope = internal sending + receiving, condition = recipient/sender
matches the élu domains, action = add `suivi-membres@pauseia.fr` in Bcc (or
"also deliver to"). The rule applies org-wide, so new members need nothing.

**Members table.** Created on the fly from the mail headers (`Name <email>`): a
member appears the first time they mail an élu·e. Group addresses (`campagne@`,
`contact@`, `all@`, …) are excluded (`GROUP_ADDRESSES` in the script). An
optional Google Directory sync could pre-populate members who haven't mailed yet
— not required for the automation to work.

**Config** (secrets env file): `MEMBER_IMAP_USER`, `MEMBER_IMAP_APP_PASSWORD`
(the audit mailbox), optional `MEMBER_IMAP_HOST`/`PORT`/`MAILBOX`. Shares
`IMAP_DB_PATH` and `IMPORT_AUTO_PUBLISH` with the campaign importer.

```bash
python3 utils/import_member_mails.py --backfill --dry-run --verbose   # preview
python3 utils/import_member_mails.py --backfill --auto-publish         # first pass
python3 utils/import_member_mails.py                                   # daily incremental
```

**Daily run:** install `deploy/import-member-mails.{service,timer}` (06:10) the
same way as the campaign unit:
```bash
sudo cp utils/deploy/import-member-mails.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp utils/deploy/import-member-mails.timer   /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now import-member-mails.timer
```

New data lives in `members` and `mail_members` (created by the script); the mail
summary also names the member and the élu·e, so it shows in the existing UI
without any change to `app.py`.

**Member address format** doesn't matter: the full address is taken verbatim
from the header (`prenom@`, `prenom.n@`, `p.nom@`, …), so disambiguated logins
work with no special handling. Only the domain (`@pauseia.fr`) and the
group-exclusion list matter.

**Élu·e replies from a non-official address** (personal, cabinet, attaché) are
still attributed, by three layered fallbacks:

1. **Address + learned aliases** — every address in the headers is resolved
   against `persons.email` **and** learned aliases (`person_emails`).
2. **Body scan** — a reply usually quotes the original, which carries the élu·e's
   official address; that is matched even if the reply's `From` is something else.
3. **Thread linking** — `In-Reply-To` / `References` inherit the élu·e from the
   mail this one replies to (`thread_persons`).

**Auto-learning:** when a reply is tied to an élu·e via the thread but comes from
a new non-official address, that address is **recorded as an alias**
(`person_emails`), so all later mails to/from it match directly — no thread
needed. The system gets more robust on its own over time. The only case still
unmatched is a member writing to a brand-new non-official address that has never
appeared in a thread; it resolves itself as soon as one reply threads back.

## 7. Eurodéputé·es — automatic weekly refresh (`extract_` + `insert_eurodeputes.py`)

French MEPs are seeded like the other chambers, but — unlike deputies/senators —
their list is kept **in sync automatically**, so a mid-term replacement or a new
intake after a European election appears in the CRM on its own (this closes the
"MEPs present locally but missing on the deployed app" gap).

- **`extract_eurodeputes.py`** — downloads the members *sitting today* from the
  European Parliament open-data API (`data.europarl.europa.eu`, endpoint
  `meps/show-current?country-of-representation=FR`). Emails are **published by
  the Parliament** (`hasEmail`), never guessed. Writes
  `actual_dataset/eurodeputes_fr.json`.
- **`insert_eurodeputes.py`** — upserts them into `persons` (role
  `Député·e européen·ne`, group mapped to the exact `POLITICAL_GROUPS` label,
  email as published). Idempotent: new MEPs inserted, missing emails backfilled,
  departed MEPs **reported but never deleted** (their meeting/mail history is
  kept).

**Why it stays fast and doesn't get rate-limited.** The per-MEP detail endpoint
rate-limits (HTTP 429), and a member's email never changes, so `extract` uses the
previous `eurodeputes_fr.json` as a **cache** and only calls the detail endpoint
for identifiers it has never resolved (a genuine newcomer). A normal week is one
list call and **zero** detail calls; the week after an election, only the handful
of new members. A guard aborts the run (leaving the good file untouched) if more
than a quarter of members come back without an email — the signature of a
throttled run — so a degraded fetch can never overwrite good data.

```bash
python3 utils/extract_eurodeputes.py     # refresh the dataset (cached)
python3 utils/insert_eurodeputes.py      # upsert into persons
```

**Weekly run:** install `deploy/sync-eurodeputes.{service,timer}` (Monday 05:50,
before the mail imports). The service seeds the committed dataset into the
container first (so a restarted container has a warm cache), then runs
`extract && insert`:

```bash
sudo cp utils/deploy/sync-eurodeputes.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp utils/deploy/sync-eurodeputes.timer   /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now sync-eurodeputes.timer
```

> **Automatic:** new/replacement MEPs (with email) and political-group changes.
> **Deliberately manual:** removing an MEP who has left the Parliament (kept for
> history), and overwriting an existing official email (never auto-replaced).

## 5. Campaign-mail import (`import_campaign_mails.py`)

Unlike the seed scripts above, this one is **recurring**. It feeds the CRM from
the follow-up mailbox that receives a BCC of every mail citizens send to their
élu·e through the site. It matches each mail's recipient against `persons.email`
(or an `X-Elu-Id` marker) and records one mail per message.

Two output modes:

- **Moderation queue (default).** One draft in `pending_mails` — the same queue
  as anonymous "declarer" submissions — with the matched names in
  `proposed_people`, so a certified (Tier 2) member validates each import on
  `/moderation`. Use this while confirming that matching is reliable.
- **Auto-publish** (`--auto-publish`, or `IMPORT_AUTO_PUBLISH=1`). Writes straight
  into the real `mails` table with a structured `mail_persons` link to every
  matched person — a real mail to several élu·es is one mail with several links,
  never duplicated. Because matching yields a **certain `persons.id`** (email
  match or the marker header), this is a clean full automation once the `To:`
  test below is trusted. Recommended path: run a backfill in moderation mode
  first, confirm the drafts match the right élu·es, then switch the cron to
  `--auto-publish`.

Only the Python standard library is used (`imaplib`, `email`) — no extra
dependency.

### Configuration (env, never hard-coded)

Add to the server env file (`/opt/volunteer-apps/secrets/website-meeting.env`),
reading the app password from Vaultwarden:

```
IMAP_HOST=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_USER=suivi-campagne@pauseia.fr
IMAP_APP_PASSWORD=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# optional: IMAP_PORT (993), IMAP_MAILBOX (INBOX), IMAP_DB_PATH (<repo>/meetings.db)
```

`suivi-campagne@pauseia.fr` is a member of the group `campagne@pauseia.fr` (the
BCC target), set to receive every message.

### Running

```bash
# One-off first pass over the whole mailbox history:
python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --backfill

# Preview without writing:
python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --backfill --dry-run

# Daily incremental (only IMAP UIDs newer than the last processed one):
python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py

# Full automation once matching is trusted (writes straight to the mails table):
python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --auto-publish
```

### Historical backfill from the group (`.mbox`)

`suivi-campagne@pauseia.fr` only receives mail sent **after** it joined the group,
so the older history lives in the **Google Group archive** (`campagne@pauseia.fr`),
which IMAP cannot read. **Do not forward the old mails by hand** — a Gmail
"Transférer" rewrites `To:` to the follow-up mailbox and buries the original
recipient in the body, so nothing would match.

Instead export the group archive via **Google Takeout** (→ a `.mbox` file, which
keeps each message's original `To:` header) and import it once:

```bash
python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --mbox groupe-campagne.mbox --dry-run
python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --mbox groupe-campagne.mbox --auto-publish
```

Same matching and same Message-ID dedup as the IMAP path, so it is safe to run
alongside (or before) the live IMAP import without double-counting.

Works from a Takeout of a **group member's own mailbox** too: individual
("every email") deliveries keep the original `To:`, and **digest / abridged**
deliveries — which bundle several posts into one email — are automatically
exploded into their embedded `message/rfc822` messages, so each post is matched
on its real recipient.

### Last resort: text pasted from the Groups web view (`--pasted`)

When no export is possible at all (no Vault, no admin export, digest-only
mailboxes), the group's web archive can still be **copy-pasted** into a text
file. `--pasted FILE` parses the `to: <élu>` / `À : <élu>` lines, keeps only
official-domain addresses (élu·es), ignores media recipients, and skips anything
already recorded for the same person on the same date (so it won't duplicate the
mbox/IMAP/eml imports).

```bash
python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --pasted campagne.txt --dry-run --verbose
python3 utils/import_campaign_mails.py --pasted campagne.txt --auto-publish
```

It only recovers the recipient, date and the fact a mail was sent — not a precise
subject — but that is enough for the CRM's "which élu·e was contacted, and when".

Duplicates are avoided two ways: the last processed IMAP UID is remembered per
mailbox (incremental runs fetch only `UID > last`), and every `Message-ID` is
recorded, so a mail is never staged twice even across a backfill/daily overlap.
Both live in tables this script owns (`imported_mail_state`, `imported_mails`),
separate from the app schema.

### Matching

- **Primary:** an `X-Elu-Id` / `X-Depute-Id` header carrying a `persons.id`, if
  the site injects one when generating the mail — match-certain even if the
  official address changes.
- **Fallback:** every address in `To`, `Cc`, `X-Original-To` and `Delivered-To`
  matched case-insensitively against `persons.email`. One draft per matched
  person (a mail may target several élu·es).

### RGPD

Following the brief's minimisation principle, an imported record keeps only the
**élu·e, the date and the mail's subject** — the citizen's identity is **never
stored** (the `From` header is not read). The subject is retained for campaign
context; drop it too if the association's policy calls for it.

> ⚠️ **Validate the `To:` test first.** If the Google Group rewrites the `To:`
> header, the address fallback breaks — check `X-Original-To` / `Delivered-To`
> in a real received message, or have the site inject the `X-Elu-Id` marker. This
> conditions the whole matching logic.

### Turnkey deployment (`deploy/deploy.sh`)

On the server, one script does the whole rollout — DB backup, email sync,
backfill, and the systemd timer. It runs the Python **inside the app container**
(via `docker cp` + `docker exec`) so it executes as the user that owns
`meetings.db`; running it on the host as another user fails with "attempt to
write a readonly database". The container needs outbound network (for IMAP and
the elus.json fetch), which it has:

```bash
cd /opt/volunteer-apps/apps/website-meeting
DRY_RUN=1 bash utils/deploy/deploy.sh                 # preview, writes nothing
bash utils/deploy/deploy.sh                           # real run, moderation queue
AUTO=1 bash utils/deploy/deploy.sh                    # real run, auto-publish
MBOX=~/groupe-campagne.mbox bash utils/deploy/deploy.sh   # + replay group history
```

The daily timer defaults to the moderation queue; add `IMPORT_AUTO_PUBLISH=1` to
the secrets env file to make the daily run auto-publish. The unit files it installs
live in `utils/deploy/`. The manual steps below are the same thing spelled out.

### Deployment on the server (systemd timer, manual)

This is a short periodic job, so a **systemd timer** (oneshot service + timer)
fits better than a 24/7 service — same server, same `systemd`/`/opt` conventions
as the other Pause IA bots. The script runs **inside the app container** so its
DB path (`/app/meetings.db`) is the persisted volume, and the app password is
loaded from the secrets env file (never on the command line).

`/etc/systemd/system/import-campaign-mails.service`:

```ini

## Pont CiviCRM (voir `AUTOMATISATION_CIVICRM.md`)

CiviCRM porte ~12 900 journalistes avec leur adresse et leur média. On ne les
recopie pas : une fiche est créée le jour où un membre échange avec la personne.
Les scripts ci-dessous ne parlent jamais à CiviCRM — ils lisent le JSON que `cv`
a écrit, en lecture seule, orchestrés depuis l'hôte.
