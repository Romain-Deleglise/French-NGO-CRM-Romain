"""One-off maintenance script — NOT part of the web app.

Run it by hand to insert the sitting French MEPs from
actual_dataset/eurodeputes_fr.json into the app's `persons` table:

    python3 utils/extract_eurodeputes.py     # refresh the dataset first
    python3 utils/insert_eurodeputes.py

Mapping applied per MEP:
- role            -> "Député·e européen·ne"
- political_group -> mapped from the EP group code to the app's exact
                     POLITICAL_GROUPS label (see GROUPE_TO_GROUP)
- stance          -> "Inconnu" (unknown until someone contacts them)
- email           -> as published by the Parliament (not derived, unlike the
                     Sénat addresses in insert_senateurices.py)
- circonscription -> NULL: French MEPs are elected on a single national list,
                     so there is no territory to record, the same way the
                     government rows carry no circonscription
- added_by / validated_by -> NULL (imported, not entered by a moderator)

Safe to re-run after a European election: a member already present is skipped
(their email is still backfilled if missing), and one who has left the
Parliament is reported but never deleted — they may have meetings recorded
against them, and that history is worth keeping.
